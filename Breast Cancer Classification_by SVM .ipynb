However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.\n","\n","The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.\n","\n","SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors, and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine.\n","\n","Types of SVM\n","SVM can be of two types:\n","Linear SVM: Linear SVM is used for linearly separable data, which means if a dataset can be classified into two classes by using a single straight line, then such data is termed as linearly separable data, and classifier is used called as Linear SVM classifier.\n","Non-linear SVM: Non-Linear SVM is used for non-linearly separated data, which means if a dataset cannot be classified by using a straight line, then such data is termed as non-linear data and classifier used is called as Non-linear SVM classifier.# Breast Cancer Classification"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"se0T4C9yAUlX"},"source":["\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","data sheet collection : Datasets :- https://www.kaggle.com/\n","objective :- Breast Cancer Classification.\n","\n","Description:\n","Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.\n","\n","The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.\n","\n","Acknowledgements:\n","This dataset has
